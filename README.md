## About Me
Hi, I'm Fong Thai, a productivity enthusiast with many years working in IT field. Memo Rocket is my personal project to help users quickly save and organize web memos with minimal friction.

## Introduction
I built Memo Rocket to solve a common problem: capturing ideas, quotes, ... saving foreign language characters, vocabularies, sentences, ... storing images from the web instantly, without clutter of many hot-keys and switching between windows or tabs. This extension is designed for speed, simplicity, and user control.

Memo Rocket is my hobby project, not associates with any company or other individual.

## Current Features

- Customizable save location and file name. Or you completely let the app name the default file for you.
- Multiple way to capture:
    - Just click the rocket icon after you highlight some text.
    - Hotkey (Command+M / Ctrl+M) for instant memo capture. Configurable.
    - Drag and drop to the rocket icon.
- Context menu integration for quick access
- Private: No data leaves your device.
